# LaunchDarkly Sample Scala Application

We've built a simple console application that demonstrates how LaunchDarkly's SDK works. â€¨Below, you'll find the basic build procedure, but for more comprehensive instructions, you can visit your [Quickstart page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/quickstart#/).

## Build instructions

1. Install [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).
2. Copy your SDK key and feature flag key from your LaunchDarkly dashboard into `Main.scala`
3. Run `sbt run` to compile and run the sample application.
